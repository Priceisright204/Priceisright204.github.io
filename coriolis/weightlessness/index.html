 <h3 id="health-effects-of-weightlessness">Health effects of weightlessness</h3>

<p>Weightlessness is not a problem for short space flights; however, on long-duration flights it would be debilitating. Missions to Mars or beyond will present serious dangers without gravity.</p>

<p>It was initially believed that the effects of weightlessness could be counteracted through exercise. It has become clear that it is impossible for astronauts to get sufficient exercise in space to protect them. Nonetheless, several hours of daily exercise is still important to astronauts living in zero gravity.</p>

<p>Astronaut Scott Kelly just completed an important mission on the International Space Station: he stayed in space for an entire year while his identical twin brother lived on earth. This allowed scientists to compare the changes that occurred in Scott’s body to his brother’s, so NASA can better prepare for a mission to Mars. Scientists were able to more thoroughly study the effects of zero gravity on Kelly’s body.</p>

<p>Scott Kelly recently wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Endurance-Year-Space-Lifetime-Discovery-ebook/dp/B01EE0FCEK">a book</a> about his journeys in space. In his book, he describes some of the health effects he experienced from living in space.</p>

<p>In the prologue of his book, Kelly describes what it was like returning to Earth after his year in space. He could hardly stand! He writes, “All of my joints and all of my muscles are protesting the crushing pressure against gravity” (page 6). His blood pooled in his legs, causing swelling and pain, and causing low blood pressure everywhere else. His ankles were so swollen he could not find his ankle bones. His skin became hot, and he developed a strange, massive rash over his body. Doctors do not have experience with humans returning from long-duration space missions.</p>

<p>Throughout the book, Kelly writes some additional medical findings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately after landing, he is surprised by how dizzy he feels. He writes, “When I tried to unstrap myself from my seat and get up, I found I nearly couldn’t move. I felt like I weighed a thousand pounds” (page 230).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some astronauts suffer vision damage during long space missions (page 140); this may be due to increased pressure in the head. This lowers drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, which causes increased pressure on the eyes. These vision changes are permament for some astronauts and temporary for others. Kelly writes that he experienced swelling of the optic nerve and permanent choroidal folds behind the retina.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If astronauts do not exercise for several hours each day, they will lose 1 percent of bone mass each month. It is believed that astronauts have permanent structural changes in the bone. If astronauts skip a single exercise session, they feel their muscles atrophy (page 334). If an astronaut were to be injured and unable to exercise, he or she would lose bone mass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kelly writes that “more than two-thirds of space travelers suffer from some degree of space motion sickness, sometimes debilitating, and there isn’t much to be done but wait it out.” Motion-sick astronauts are as clumsy and tentative “as babies just learning to walk” until this is resolved. It can take astronauts four to six weeks to recover.
(Artificial gravity might also cause motion sickness; it is unclear how this would compare.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Despite this short list of medical greviances, Kelly was nonetheless enthusiastic about his mission. Immediately after landing, he felt confident he could have walked away from the landing site.</p>

<p>Many of the negative effects of zero-gravity have been clear since the Soviets launched <em>Mir</em>; they discovered toxic effects on the bone, muscle, and cardiovascular system.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4470275/">This paper</a> explains that zero gravity causes “debilitating and potentially fatal problems” including “bone loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, muscle weakening, sensorimotor and neurovestibular disturbances, and regulatory disorders.” Living in zero gravity causes blood to flow to the head, prompting dramatic fluid loss and increased blood thickness. After returning to Earth, thick blood flows back to the lower body, causing the heart rate to increase and blood pressure to drop. Today, returning astronauts also risk bone fractures and muscle tears during their recovery period. The paper says, “Were astronauts to embark upon a journey to Mars today, the 6-month exposure to weightlessness en route would leave them considerably debilitated.” We do not know how the low Martian gravity would affect them after arrival.</p>

<p>If the world intends to send astronauts on long-distance missions, then artificial gravity may prove essential to them.</p>
