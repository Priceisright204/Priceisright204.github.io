LOGIC FOR SOLVING THE MAZE

Hit an obstacle.
Check how many directions are available at this obstacle.
Start at the first direction and go to the next obstacle.
If the next position has already been seen, backtrack.
If no directions, then backtrack.
If you backtracked, then pick the next direction.
If you've checked all the directions, then backtrack again.
