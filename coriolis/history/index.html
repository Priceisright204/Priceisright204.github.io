 <h3 id="the-history-of-artificial-gravity-research">The history of artificial gravity research</h3>

<p>Organizations like NASA and SpaceX have been working feverishly to try to make life in space viable. Space agencies will eventually need to construct artificial gravity habitats to solve the health problems of weightlesness. Unfortunately, no space agency has active plans to build an artificial-gravity habitat, though NASA’s archives are littered with proposals for one.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things the world’s space agencies have accomplished:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Gemini 8 mission (March 1966) accidentally produced 4 g’s after a thruster incorrectly fired. The fast rotation caused intense nausea, and the astronauts nearly blacked out from the g-forces. The mission was aborted.</li>
</ul>

<div class="floatright"><div class="floatcaption" style="margin-left:20px"><i>Gemini 11</i></div>
<img src="/assets/img/Gemini_11_Agena.jpg" width="270" /></div>
<ul>
  <li>The Gemini 11 mission (September 1966) purposely rotated two capsules connected by a 36-meter tether to produce 0.0005 g. The astronauts did not feel the gravitational force (the perception threshold is about 0.2 g), but they observed objects slowly floating toward the floor of their capsule. They reported it had been “an interesting and puzzling experience.”</li>
</ul>

<div class="tryParent"><a target="_blank" href="https://kevindprice.github.io/coriolis/model#&amp;diameter=45&amp;startheight=1.2&amp;speed=0&amp;units=m&amp;gravity=.05"><div class="TryIt">Try it!</div><div class="tooltiptext"><p>Diameter=45 m</p><p>Start height=1.2 m</p><p>Angle=0°</p><p>Speed=0 m/s </p><p>Gravity=.05%</p></div></a></div>
<p>Press this green button to emulate the gravity of the Gemini 11 mission. It takes 23 seconds for a dropped coin to land.</p>

<ul>
  <li>By 1973, NASA had not recognized the need for artificial gravity. At this point, NASA’s only concern with zero gravity was motion sickness, which was only a problem for the first few days in orbit. This was the NASA flight surgeon’s position: “The magnitude of the motion-sickness problem experienced by astronauts to date does not appear to suggest clearly the need for design and incorporation of artificial gravity system in near-future space vehicles.”</li>
</ul>

<div class="floatright"><div class="floatcaption" style="color:red; margin-left: 90px; font-weight:bold;"><i>Kosmos 782</i></div>
<img src="/assets/img/Kosmos_782.jpg" width="270" /></div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Russians, however, <em>were</em> interested in artificial gravity. The Soviet space program initially believed that a human could not survive more than 14 days in space; the Soviets believed that the heart and blood vessels would be unable to adapt to weightlessness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975, on Kosmos 782, the Soviets centrifuged animals in space. Fish and turtles were centrifuged at 1 g for 20-days in a 75 cm diameter centrifuge. The researchers did not find any differences between either the centrifuged animals, animals housed in 0g, or Earth-bound animals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="floatright"><div class="floatcaption" style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><i>Skylab</i></div>
<img src="/assets/img/Skylab.gif" alt="Skylab Giphy" /></div>
<ul>
  <li>The (American) Skylab crews took advantage of the large open compartment to run around the curved circumference. Running in a circle created gravity. They reported no difficulty with either locomotion or motion sickness.</li>
</ul>
<div class="widebreak"></div>
<div class="widebreak"></div>
<div class="widebreak"></div>

<ul>
  <li>The negative effects of weightlessness became clear during long-duration missions on Russian space stations such as Mir.</li>
</ul>

<div class="floatright"><div class="floatcaption" style="margin-left: 5px;"><i>Off-axis rotator</i></div>
<img src="/assets/img/rotator.jpg" width="270" /></div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In 1998, the European Space Agency built an “off-axis rotator” for the ISS. This device centrifuged humans for seven minutes at a time at several speeds. Subjects said they felt like they were standing on their heads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several studies on Earth have looked at long-term bed rest, which produces similar health effects to zero gravity. A 1998 study in Tokyo found that one hour a day in a centrifuge prevents blood volume from dropping in a bed rester and maintains the blood-pressure reflex. In 2005, NASA conducted similar studies in their Short-Radius Centrifuge in Houston.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December 2014, NASA launched a fruit-fly centrifuge to study the effects of artificial gravity on the immune system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The scientific community periodically comes up with new gravity ideas, though we will never fully understand life in artificial gravity until we create an environment for outer space.</p>

<h4 id="rotation-and-nausea">Rotation and nausea</h4>

<p>Living in a centrifuge may be nauseating. Minimizing the rotation rate would reduce this nausea. We can reduce the <strong>revolutions per minute (rpm)</strong> by increasing the station size; however, it is unclear what rotation rate would be desirable, and large stations would be expensive. When we finally build a space station with simulated gravity, we should experiment with several rotation rates.</p>

<div class="floatright"><div class="floatcaption" style="margin-left: 79px;"><i>Are you dizzy yet?</i></div>
<img style="border-radius: 10px;" src="/assets/img/Giphy.gif" alt="Dizzy Giphy" width="300" /></div>
<p>Unlike astronauts in zero gravity, rotating astronauts must adapt to more than one sensation. While rotating, each direction of motion produces a different effect on the inner ear. This means that individuals would need to adjust to the rotation itself <em>and</em> to sudden changes in direction. Furthermore, <em>windows</em> could be disorienting on a rotating space station.</p>

<p>Nausea research on Earth began in 1958 in the <em>Slow Rotating Room,</em> a facility in Pensacola, Florida. NASA placed individuals in a slowly rotating room for several days.</p>

<div class="floatright"><div class="floatcaption" style="margin-left: 20px;"><i>NASA's Slow Rotating Room</i></div>
<img src="/assets/img/rotatingroom.jpg" alt="Slow Rotating Room" width="250" /></div>
<p>The <em>Slow Rotating Room</em> generated some important findings. Study participants quickly learned to restrict their head movements, otherwise they would feel sharp nausea reactions (“acute nausea”). Over time, these individuals adjusted and became less restricted.</p>

<p><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070001009.pdf">This page</a> explains: “Although few adverse effects are present when rotation rate is less than 1 rpm, higher rates produce motion sickness (similar to that occurring during the acute period of adaptation to weightlessness).” Researchers found that their test subjects could adapt to 3 rpm.</p>

<div class="tryParent"><a target="_blank" href="https://kevindprice.github.io/coriolis/model#&amp;diameter=200&amp;startheight=1.2&amp;speed=4&amp;units=m"><div class="TryIt">Try it!</div><div class="tooltiptext"><p>Diameter=200 m</p><p>Start height=1.2 m</p><p>Angle=0°</p><p>Speed=4 m/s </p><p>Gravity=100%</p></div></a></div>
<p>A station would need to be 200 meters to produce 3 rpm at full gravity. The International Space Station is 109 meters wide by comparison. Press this button to see the coin toss emulated on a 200-meter space station (the coin lands 20 cm away).</p>

<p>Higher rotation rates would be more difficult to adapt to. In 10 rpm, individuals showed no adaptation after 12 days. The study indicated it is possible to <em>build up</em> to this rate in small increments, about 1-2 rpm per day; this might be an impractically long adjustment. My model’s default settings display a station at about 11 rpm (the speed for 1g with a diameter of 50 feet).</p>

<p>It is unclear how significant these studies are. Unlike these studies, living in space would rotate you vertically, not horizontally.</p>

<p>A 1993 study in Udine, Italy focused on <em>vertical</em> rotation in a bicycle-powered centrifuge. Participants were able to move their heads without acute motion sickness at rates up to 19-21 rpm. Unlike the Slow Rotating Room, this study did not expose participants over several days; this would be very difficult.</p>

<p>It is not clear how well our bodies would adapt to rotation in space.</p>

<h4 id="construction-ideas">Construction ideas</h4>

<p>There are a few strategies that could be helpful for building a rotating space station.</p>

<div class="tryParent"><a target="_blank" href="https://kevindprice.github.io/coriolis/model#&amp;gravity=33"><div class="TryIt">Try it!</div><div class="tooltiptext"><p>Diameter=50 ft</p><p>Start height=4 ft</p><p>Angle=0°</p><p>Speed=14 ft/s </p><p>Gravity=33%</p></div></a></div>
<ul>
  <li>We could build a space station that produces less than 1g. This would not need to rotate as quickly, and it might produce some positive health benefits.</li>
</ul>

<div class="tryParent"><a target="_blank" href="https://kevindprice.github.io/coriolis/model#&amp;gravity=200"><div class="TryIt">Try it!</div><div class="tooltiptext"><p>Diameter=50 ft</p><p>Start height=4 ft</p><p>Angle=0°</p><p>Speed=14 ft/s </p><p>Gravity=200%</p></div></a></div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Studies have indicated that <em>intermittent</em> gravity is helpful. Would a higher rotation rate be tolerable if it is only for an hour a day? Try the coin toss in 2g!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we saw in Gemini 11, it is possible to simulate gravity by rotating two capsules connected by a tether. This may prove less expensive than building an enormous station.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A modular station could be expanded over time, allowing us to reduce the rpm requirements or increase the gravity capability. Gravity would be highest at the ends and lowest in the middle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A station’s rotation rate would require small adjustments over time. Spinning a <em>reaction wheel</em> could manage it without thrusters. Otherwise, the station would need to use propellant, which would be used up over time. This reaction wheel would spin in the opposite direction of the station and could be electrically powered. This wheel would need to be frictionless.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="actual-spacecraft-proposals">Actual Spacecraft Proposals</h4>

<ul>
  <li>In 2011, NASA proposed the rotating Nautilus-X as a possible stopover for astronauts embarking on long-distance missions; it would be relatively inexpensive and feasible (~$3bn). It seems likely that we will build something similar to this first.</li>
</ul>
<div class="center"><i>Nautilus-X (proposed)</i><br />
<img src="/assets/img/Nautilus-X.png" width="200" /></div>
<div class="widebreak"></div>

<ul>
  <li>This next image is for the Rotating Mars spacecraft, a 1989 concept idea. A space station using this tethered method could have an arbitrarily large diameter. A large space station at 1g may require exceptionally strong tethers using future materials such as carbon nanotubes.</li>
</ul>
<div class="center"><div class="floatcaption"><i>1989</i></div>
<img src="/assets/img/1989Concept.png" width="250" /></div>
<div class="widebreak"></div>

<ul>
  <li>The 1969 design below requires a few revisions to work. The center corridor would need to be an elevator or a ladder. Also, you would be unable to stand in the long cylindrical containers; they are oriented in the wrong direction. This would work if we used many <em>small</em> modules in a chain.</li>
</ul>
<div class="center"><div class="floatcaption"><i>1969</i></div>
<img src="/assets/img/Artificial_Gravity_Space_Station.png" alt="1969 concept" width="250" /></div>
<div class="widebreak"></div>

<ul>
  <li>In 1975, NASA designed a massive theoretical ring station, a “Stanford torus,” as a thought experiment. The Stanford torus has a proposed diameter of 1800 meters (1.1 miles), the minimum size to produce 1 rpm with full gravity. <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nasas-beautiful-dreams-self-sufficient-space-colony-revealed-1631672">Here</a> is an interesting news story about it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Press this button to see the coin toss emulated on the Stanford Torus. The coin toss lands 8 cm (3 in) away. Perhaps someday we will reach out to the stars with a station like this one.</p>
