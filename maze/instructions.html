    <h1><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>About Open-Wall Mazes</span></h1>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>The open-wall or &#8216;hay-bales&#8217; maze is a favorite invention of mine. It feels like a corn maze: you&#8217;re never quite sure where you&#8217;re going to end up! An open-wall maze is more difficult than a regular maze and takes more time to solve. It is a puzzle!</span></p>

        <!--<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'></span></p>A hay-bales maze is to a regular maze as Sudoku is to counting on your fingers.-->

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>I first thought of the idea after visiting Mount Vernon (George Washington&#8217;s home) some time as a middle schooler. At the plantation, there was a maze set up using hay bales. It was like a corn maze, except there was a catch: you were only allowed to turn when you hit a wall. Otherwise, you were required to continue straight. The maze was tricky. I made it through, but it required me to explore a bit and to repeat my paths a few times.</span></p><!-- Some people would give up after trying for a minute, expecting a simple maze. the <span class=GramE>hay</span> bales were short and you could see where you were going.  After hitting a wall, you <span class=GramE>were allowed</span> to choose which way to turn. I saw some children running through it doing what they wanted to and not following the simple maze rules. -->

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>The maze fascinated me. It dawned on me that this maze could easily be recreated using graph paper in the same way that a corn maze could be &#8216;drawn&#8217; on regular paper. I created the system of walls and turns that you see in my maze here. I also added a &#8216;permeable&#8217; wall where you can also choose to go forward, just to make things more interesting. I started drawing &#8216;hay-bales&#8217; mazes on graph paper and showing my friends.</span></p>

        <!--<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'></span></p>I saw the same result with the graph paper as I had seen in the maze at Mount Vernon: most people did not expect a complicated puzzle and would only spend a minute on it.-->

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>Now I have created a digital version of an open-wall maze that makes it easier to stay in-line. I think it is more fun this way, too, because you can see your line progressing on the page!</span></p><!-- (I would not let people draw lines on my mazes).-->

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>Below, I have included a few of my old mazes. The one on the left was drawn sometime in middle school, from 2000-2003. It incorporates a few additional obstacles that I have not included in later mazes (directional obstacles). The second maze was drawn in 2013 and then digitized shortly afterward. </span></p>
