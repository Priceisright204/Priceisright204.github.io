 <h2 id="the-math-behind-this-model-difference-from-throw-on-earth">The math behind this model: “Difference from throw on Earth”</h2>

<p>As I began putting this computer model together, I wanted a simple go-to measurement for the difference between a rotating throw and a throw on Earth. This provided me a fascinating physics problem. My goal was to calculate, if a person were to toss a coin in a rotating environment, how far away would it land from their feet?</p>

<h4 id="set-up-the-problem">Set-up the problem</h4>

<p>To fully understand what happens during our coin toss, we must use a perspective that is not rotating. When beginning to solve a physics problem, it is important to establish a coordinate system. This helps to make sense of what is going on.</p>

<p>The station is a virtual coordinate system with (0,0) at its exact center. I imagined the station rotating clockwise.</p>

<p>Here are some conditions for this coin toss:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the moment of the throw, the person is standing at the bottom of the circle, at 270 degrees or 3π/2 radians.</li>
  <li>The person is holding the coin at 4 feet from the floor. This is the starting height.</li>
  <li>The person throws the coin straight upward at 14 ft/s, which would have sent the coin about 3 feet up in the air on Earth.</li>
  <li>The rotating space station has a diameter of 50 feet. It is rotating at the speed necessary to produce 1g of acceleration, or 100% Earth gravity at the floor.</li>
  <li>The coin experiences less than this amount of centripetal acceleration or “gravity” because it is not at the floor.</li>
</ul>

<div class="center"><img src="/coriolis/assets/img/CoordinateSystem.png" width="300" height="300" /></div>

<p>Before the throw, the coin has a leftwards velocity due to the clockwise rotation; the throw adds an upwards velocity of 14 ft/s (the throw speed). These two velocity components define the direction that the coin travels through the air, which we will need to calculate so we can determine where it lands.</p>

<p>The picture below is a diagram of these velocity components. $V$ represents the magnitude and direction of the coin’s velocity, and $V_x$ and $V_y$ are its components. $V_x$ equals the speed the coin was rotating at before the throw, and $V_y$ is 14 ft/s. $F_c$ is the centripetal force which disappears at the moment the coin is released.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="/coriolis/assets/img/BeforeThrow.png" width="200" height="200" /><img src="/coriolis/assets/img/AfterThrow.png" width="200" height="200" /></div>

<p>Now that I have set up the problem, I will explain the next steps. Ideally, I would like a single equation that can solve the problem for me. Unfortunately, such an equation would be messy and impossible to simplify, so we will solve this in steps. We want to find how far away a coin would land from the thrower’s feet. To find this, we need to find the coordinates of where both the thrower and the coin would end up.</p>

<p>First, we need the magnitude and direction of the coin’s velocity after it launches. Using this, we can solve for its landing coordinate and the time it elapsed in the air. We can then use the time elapsed in the air to find where the thrower would end up in an equivalent time period. We can use this to find the separation between the coin and the thrower’s feet.</p>

<p>Here are the steps to solving our math problem:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Calculate the rotation speed at the floor in radians per second</li>
  <li>Use the rotation speed to calculate the horizontal speed of the coin in feet per second</li>
  <li>Calculate the magnitude and direction of the coin’s overall velocity through the air</li>
  <li>Find the coin’s landing coordinates</li>
  <li>Calculate the time elapsed as the coin traveled through the air</li>
  <li>Calculate the arc swept by the thrower during this same time</li>
  <li>Calculate the thrower’s final coordinates</li>
  <li>Calculate the distance between the thrower’s feet and the coin when the coin lands</li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="starting-velocity">Starting Velocity</h4>

<p>We need the vertical and horizontal velocity components of the coin. The vertical velocity has been given to us as 14 ft/s, the throw speed of the coin. The horizontal velocity is currently unknown.</p>

<p>Before we solve for the coin’s initial horizontal velocity, please note that the coin does not feel the same force of gravity as you do on the floor of the station. It has a smaller radius to the center of the station because you are holding it in your hand; the coin starts at a height of 4 ft from the floor. Thus, the coin’s horizontal velocity would not be <em>quite</em> the same as if it were touching the floor.</p>

<p>The floor’s “gravity” is a constant acceleration toward the center. This is the equation for centripetal acceleraton:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">a=\frac{v^2}{r}</script>

<p>Variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a is the acceleration felt by the object in ft/s/s</li>
  <li>$v$ is the horizontal (tangential) velocity of an object on the station in ft/s</li>
  <li>r is the radius, or distance from the object to the center of rotation in feet</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, we do not know either the acceleration felt by the coin or its current horizontal velocity. This is why we will need the rotational speed at the floor. The rotational speed in radians per second will be equivalent at the floor and at the coin. We <em>do</em> know the acceleration felt at the floor.</p>

<p>Rotational, or angular, velocity is related to linear velocity. This relationship is defined by $v=r*\omega$ where $\omega$ is the rotational rate of the station in radians/second.</p>

<p>We can use this with our centripetal acceleration equation to get rotational speed.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">a=\omega^2r</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\omega=\sqrt {\frac {a}{r}}</script>

<p>In our formula:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$a=-32.174$ ft/s/s, the acceleration at the floor</li>
  <li>$r$ is the radius of the station, or 25 feet.</li>
  <li>$\omega$ is the rotational speed in radians per second</li>
</ul>

<p>We can then use $\omega$ to calculate the horizontal velocity of the coin. The radius at the coin will be 25 ft minus 4 ft, or 21 feet. Therefore, $v_x=21*\omega$. This value will be negative because the coin is traveling left and is rotating clockwise.</p>

<p>If you put all of this together, you get:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">v_x = -\sqrt {\frac{a}{r_{s}}}*(r_{s}-h_{c})</script>

<p>Our variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a = the acceleration of the station, -32.174 ft/s/s</li>
  <li>$r_{s}$ = the radius of the station</li>
  <li>$h_{c}$ = the starting height of the coin</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="the-coins-landing-coordinates">The Coin’s Landing Coordinates</h4>

<p>We can use the velocity components of the coin to find its landing coordinates. The coin is traveling up and to the left in a straight line; the slope of the path it follows is the fraction of the two velocity components, $\frac{v_y}{v_x}$.</p>

<p>The equation for a line: $y = mx + b$</p>

<p>Our variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$m=\frac{v_y}{v_x}$, it will be <em>negative</em>.</li>
  <li>$b=$ the y-intercept $=-(r_{s}-h_{c})$</li>
</ul>

<p>My computer tells me that $v_x=-23.82329$ ft/s, and $v_y=13.80403$ ft/s. This is the formula for the path of the coin:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y=-.579434x-21</script>

<p>Now, we need to find where this line intersects with a circle. Here is the formula for a circle:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x^2 + y^2 = r^2</script>

<p>We can cheat and solve this using an <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">online graphing website</a>:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="/coriolis/assets/img/IntersectPoint.png" width="250" height="250" /></div>

<p>In this image, you can see the path of the coin and its final intersection with the ground, up and to the left. The coin starts at the y-intercept.</p>

<p>Now, we will solve this by hand. For our computer model, we need formulas that the computer can solve!</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x^2 + y^2 = r_{s}^2</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y=mx-r_{c}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x^2 + (mx-r_{c})^2 = r_{s}^2</script>

<p>Rearrange and simplify to a quadratic equation (format $0=ax^2+bx+c$):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">0=(1+m^2)x^2-2mr_{c}x+(r_{c}^2-r_{s}^2)</script>

<p>The quadratic formula:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=\frac {-b\pm\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}</script>

<p>Plug in our variables and simplify (I skipped a few steps for brevity):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=\frac{mr_{c}\pm\sqrt{m^2r_{c}^2-(1+m^2)(r_{c}^2-r_{s}^2)}}{1+m^2}</script>

<p>This is our formula for the x-coordinate of the coin. The correct value will be the answer that is negative, because the coin goes to the <em>left</em>. The equation correctly gives us -23.967 when we solve with the (-) operator.</p>

<p>Now we need to solve for the y-component that matches this x-component:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x^2 + y^2= r_{s}^2</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y=\sqrt {r_{s}^2-x^2}</script>

<p>This gives us 7.113. There is one problem: solving this way only gives us the <em>absolute value</em> of the y-component!</p>

<p>To get the correct sign of the y-component, we need to use the quadratic formula <em>again</em>.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y=mx-r_{c}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=\frac{y+r_{c}}{m}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left(\frac {y+r_{c}}{m}\right)^2 + y^2= r_{s}^2</script>

<p>Rearrange and simplify to a quadratic equation:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">0=y^2(1+m^2)+2r_{c}y+(r_{c}^2-r_{s}^2m^2)</script>

<p>Put into the quadratic formula and simplify:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y=\frac{-r_{c}\pm\sqrt{r_{c}^2-(1+m^2)(r_{c}^2-r_{s}^2m^2)}}{1+m^2}</script>

<p>We already know the absolute value of the y-component. The quadratic formula tells us that this number should be negative, -7.113. We arrived at this number using the (+) operator.</p>

<p>Our final coordinates are (-23.967, -7.113). This matches the values from the graphing website.</p>

<p>The correct operators in the quadratic formula were (-) when solving for x, and (+) when solving for y. This is fairly intuitive, because the coin moves up and to the left (negative x direction, positive y direction).</p>

<p>These operators differ if the coin moves in a direction other than up and to the left (e.g. if it is thrown in a direction other than straight up). Fortunately, the operators are intuitive based on which direction the coin moves.</p>

<p>Thus, our final formulas are:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=\frac{mr_{c}-\sqrt{m^2r_{c}^2-(1+m^2)(r_{c}^2-r_{s}^2)}}{1+m^2}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y=\frac{-r_{c}+\sqrt{r_{c}^2-(1+m^2)(r_{c}^2-r_{s}^2m^2)}}{1+m^2}</script>

<p>Our variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$m=\frac {v_y}{v_x}$. $v_x$ is negative because the coin is moving left.</li>
  <li>$r_{c}$ is the radius at the coin.</li>
  <li>$r_{s}$ is the radius of the station.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="time-elapsed-in-the-air">Time Elapsed in the Air</h4>

<p>Now that we have the landing coordinates, we can solve for the exact time elapsed using kinematics equations. First, we need the distance traveled. We will calculate this using the Pythagorean Theorem. The final coordinates of the coin are (x_f, y_f), and the initial coordinates are (0,$-r_{c}$).</p>

<p>Pythagorean theorem: $d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$.</p>

<p>Using our variables: $d=\sqrt{x_f^2+(y_f+r_{c})^2}$</p>

<p>We also need to solve for the velocity. We have the x and y components. The velocity, with the Pythagorean theorem, is $v=\sqrt {v_x^2 + v_y^2}$.</p>

<p>We know from basic kinematics that $d=vt$ for objects that are not accelerating. We can rearrange this and plug in our values. We get:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">t=\frac {\sqrt{x_f^2+(y_f+r_{c})^2}}{\sqrt {v_x^2 + v_y^2}}</script>

<p>Our variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$x_f$ = the final x-coordinate of the coin</li>
  <li>$y_f$ = the final y-coordinate of the coin</li>
  <li>$v_x$ = the velocity x-component</li>
  <li>$v_y$ = the velocity y-component</li>
  <li>$r_{c}$ = the radius at the coin, before it is launched</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="the-arc-swept-by-the-person">The Arc Swept By the Person</h4>

<p>We can use the time variable to calculate the angle a person will cover while the coin is in the air. This will give us the final coordinates of the person.</p>

<p>We have already calculated the station’s rotation rate in the beginning of our problem. This is $\omega$, in radians/second.</p>

<p>The person starts at an angle of $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ (270 degrees). The person is sweeping a negative arc, because they are traveling clockwise (counterclockwise is positive for angles).</p>

<p>If $\theta_t$ is the total arc swept by the person, then you would expect $\theta_t=\theta_f-\theta_0$. However, you must keep in mind the negative direction of the arc being traveled. We can switch the sign by flipping the terms of the equation. Thus, our formula is $\theta_t=\theta_0-\theta_f$, where $\theta_0=\frac{3\pi}{2}$. Now rearrange the terms:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\theta_f = \theta_0 - \theta_t</script>

<p>With rotational kinematics, we can calculate the arc swept by the person:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\theta_t = \omega t</script>

<p>Put the equations together:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\theta_f = \theta_0 - \omega t</script>

<p>We have just calculated the person’s final angle in the station. Now, we have a set of polar coordinates: we have the final angle and the radius. We can convert these polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates using the equations:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=r*cos(\theta)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y=r*sin(\theta)</script>

<p>Our final x and y coordinates:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=r*cos(\frac{3\pi}{2} - \omega t)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y=r*sin(\frac{3\pi}{2} - \omega t)</script>

<p>Our variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>r = the radius of the station</li>
  <li>$\omega$ = the rotational rate of the station (calculated when we found the horizontal velocity)</li>
  <li>t = the time elapsed while the coin is in the air</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="the-final-answer">The Final Answer</h4>

<p>Now that we have the landing coordinates of the coin, and the person’s final coordinates, we can calculate the straight line distance between the two using the Pythagorean theorem. This formula gives us our answer:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">d = \sqrt{(x_{c}-x_{person})^2 + (y_{c}-y_{person})^2}</script>

<p>Javascript calculates to a precision of about 15 decimal points. This is insufficient for some calculations; thus my code uses the Decimal.js package to support 30 decimal places instead. The model breaks up the path of the coin into 100 pieces and moves real-time between them to make a realistic arc on the screen.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="max-height-achieved">Max Height Achieved</h4>

<p>My table also displays the max height achieved by the coin. Unfortunately, there is no formula to calculate this. I generated this number by creating a maximization script; the script sweeps up and down the path of the coin to find the point that is at the farthest distance from the circle.</p>
